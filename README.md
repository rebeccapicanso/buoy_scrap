# Buoy Scrap

Inspired by the efforts of NDBC, the National Data Buoy Center, and Gloria Chung, a NY NY based filmmaker.

This project is under development right now, happy to provide psuedocode for unfinished portions. It's training locally on my machine.

At the moment, index.html & buoygrab.py are the most functional.
